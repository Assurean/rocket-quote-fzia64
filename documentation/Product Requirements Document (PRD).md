## 8.5 DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTS

| Environment | Purpose | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development | Feature development | Single region, minimal resources |
| Staging | Integration testing | Multi-region, production-like |
| UAT | User acceptance testing | Production mirror |
| Production | Live system | Multi-region, fully redundant |
| DR | Disaster recovery | Standby environment |

```
1.	Include a Phase-by-Phase Implementation Roadmap
	•	Outline a tentative timeline: MVP (must-have features), second iteration (enhanced ML scoring, advanced cross-sell), third iteration (direct-bind).
	•	This helps stakeholders prioritize development tasks and plan resource allocation.
	2.	Expand on ML Operationalization
	•	Clarify model deployment pipeline: is it CI/CD integrated for data science workflows? Do you have a separate environment for model training?
	•	Mention how you’ll handle model performance regression or what metrics (precision, recall, lead acceptance rate) the ML team is optimizing.
	3.	Detail Post-Sale Analytics
	•	If carriers or agents provide outcome data (did the user buy a policy?), specify how that data loops back to refine scoring and bundling logic.
	•	Emphasize metrics like actual conversion vs. initial form fill.
	4.	UI Wireframes or Storyboards
	•	Adding sample wireframes or mockups for each vertical funnel, the buyer portal interface, and click wall layout would provide clarity to designers and developers.
	5.	Stress Test & Load Testing Approach
	•	The PRD references concurrency and performance targets but could specify how you plan to load test (tools like JMeter, Locust, Gatling) and which KPIs determine success/failure.
